Etch-A-Sketch PCB by Brendan Hlibok, 2023

This project consists of a 4-layer PCB designed by Brendan Hlibok using EAGLE software.
The PCB functions as an etch-a-sketch when manufactured. More specific information on this can be found in the
powerpoint presentation under project_02/docs.

The library, schematic, and board layout files can be found in the "EAGLE" folder, and the gerber files for manufacturing
the PCB. The "docs" folder contains descriptive information such as images of important layers, the schematics,
the board layout, and a bill of materials for the product. The bill of materials is in .txt and .csv format, where the .txt
file came straight from the EAGLE software, and the excel file has specific component parts and descriptions.

The board file can be uploaded to manufacturing sites to check quotes for building the board. The site used for this project was
MacroFab.

This project was completed as a part of the ENGI 301 course at Rice University taught by Erik Welsh, who designed the circuit
for the PCB in this file.
